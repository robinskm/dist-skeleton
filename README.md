## Setup
This project uses npm and gulp. You will need Node.js, npm, and **gulp@3.9.1** installed on your machine to run this solution.

###### Run:
> `cd /Directory/of/dist-skeleton; npm install; gulp;`

This command will install all packages & run the gulp file.

**Note: This version of gulp is deprecated. Do not update to gulp@4.0.0 or higher as this will break the solution. Update pending.**


* This solution minifies, concats, & maps .scss and .js files on save
* Any new .scss files can be added in /scss/theme.scss
* JavaScript files will be added automaticallly


## Getting Started
* All styling and functionality should be done in /src
* /dist is the 'hand off' folder. Gulp does its thing and saves it here.
